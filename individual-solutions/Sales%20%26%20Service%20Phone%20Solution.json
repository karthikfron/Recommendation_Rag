  "description": "As part of Contact Center Simulations, the Sales & Service Phone Solution includes a contact center simulation and three behavioral tests designed to measure a wide range of skills, competencies, and behavioral tendencies relevant for contact center jobs. This solution is designed for contact center roles that involve sales or sales-related behaviors such as recommending products or services and retaining customers. Sample tasks for these jobs include: interact with customers on the phone to sell a product/service; add new or upgraded products or services; extend promotional or retention offers; respond appropriately to customer objections; navigate to information menus to assist the customer and process information; and type information quickly and accurately. Potential job titles that use this simulation are: Telesales Representative, Telemarketer, and Contact Center Representative. The behavioral tests in this solution are intended to measure the candidateâ€™s sales focus, learning potential, and the tendency to meet goals and work hard, even when faced with obstacles. Collectively, the assessments in this solution measure a wide range of important skills, abilities, and behaviors for entry-level contact center roles involving sales or sales and service.",
