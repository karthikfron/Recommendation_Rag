  "description": "This OPQ (Occupational Personality Questionnaire) report is based on the Universal Competency framework. It graphically outlines how an individual's typical way of behaving is likely to impact on competencies. It provides a graphical scale for each competency and summarises aspects of personality which contribute (positively or negatively) to each competency.\n\nPlease note this report is currently being updated on Talent Central as part of a reporting refresh project, and there may be visual differences when comparing Talent Central reports to ones generated on other assessment platforms. Differences are regarding the layout and display of the reports only and do not affect the underlying scoring. When viewing sample reports, please ensure you select the appropriate language and platform example.\n\nWhere a sample report has no platform indicated, it is available on both the Talent Central and SODA platforms.",
