  "title": "MFS 360 UCF Performance Potential Dev Tips Report",
  "description": "This report is more or less identical to the standard MFS report but with an additional section that looks at the performance versus the potential and plots the competencies on a four field grid to identify developed strengths, natural strengths, development need, or untapped potential. The report text has been updated to reflect the inclusion of the OPQ, and the potential is also shown in the competency summary part of the report. The OPQ scores that feed into this report will need to be uploaded into MFS using an upload sheet based on a score extract from SODA or TC. This particular example report also includes development tips which are an optional extra.",
