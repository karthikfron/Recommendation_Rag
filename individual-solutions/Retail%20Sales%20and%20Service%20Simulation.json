  "description": "The Retail Sales and Service Simulation measures the ability of a candidate to choose effective sales and service techniques while interacting with customers. Situations are presented to the candidate via computer-based animation, and the candidate is offered a set of behaviors from which to choose the most and least effective responses. The behaviors vary in the extent to which the sales associate may: direct a conversation toward a commitment or sale, listen carefully to customers and provide options that address what they really need/want, put aside work to assist a customer, and focus on meeting customer needs. Responses are tracked and compared against expert ratings of effectiveness. The test produces an overall score, as well as scores on two subscales, Customer Service Effectiveness and Sales Effectiveness.",
