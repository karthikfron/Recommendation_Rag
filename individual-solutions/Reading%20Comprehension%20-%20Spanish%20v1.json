  "description": "The Reading Comprehension - Spanish assessment provides a general measure of Spanish reading comprehension. This test is comprised of items that contain a passage that must read in order to answer the question being asked. The questions focus on the ability to demonstrate an understanding of the passage. Questions may be specific in nature, with answers that can be found almost word for word in the passage. For example, the question may ask for a date, name or place that can be found by closely reading through the passage. Alternatively, the questions may be general in nature, with answers that can be determined only by fully understanding the meaning of the passage. \"What is the theme of the passage?\" or \"What is the mood of the author?\" are examples of general questions that may be asked.",
